### Introducing

# Sicard Hollow

#### Sicard Hollow is a four-piece progressive bluegrass band who formed with a mutual passion for pushing the boundaries of genre. Heavily influenced by the Grateful Dead and New Grass Revival, these young pickers bring new energy to a timeless style with a combination of fearless improvisation and instrumental prowess.

## Formation

The band formed through mutual connections within the Nashville music scene who all wanted to play something different. They were all simultaneously discovering bluegrass while existing in their other scenes. Once they got together, the rest was history. Having toured extensively around the Southeast for the last year, this group of players continues to grow their sound with every performance. Having always thought of themselves as a live band, producer, Dan Davis, had his work cut out for him while producing their debut album, Secret of the Breeze, at Zac Brown and Oliver Wood's Southern Ground Nashville. The result was a perfect encapsulation of the band's genre-kicking tenacity. There is no slowing down for Sicard Hollow.

## Past Performances

Sicard Hollow has opened up for acts such as Sam Bush, Infamous Stringdusters, Rumpke Mountain Boys, Kyle Tuttle, Jarod Pool, CBDB, The Sweet Lilies, and Amoramora. Theyâ€™ve also played at festivals such as Summer Camp Music & Arts Festival, The Peach Music & Arts Festival, Bluegrass in the Bottoms, Birds of a Feather, and Resonate.
