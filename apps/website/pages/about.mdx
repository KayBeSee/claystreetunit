### Introducing

# Clay Street Unit

Based out of Denver, CO, Clay Street Unit is a seven piece group rooted deep in homegrown southern folk/country and branches into the bluegrass sound thatâ€™s heard throughout the Appalachian hills.

Forming in early 2021, the band just recently released their first EP and is working on developing and pushing their own unique sound, with a high energy, fresh take on the tradition of American folk and country music that is sure to keep you moving.
